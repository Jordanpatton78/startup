This is a web application that will allow students to feel more comfortable asking questions during lectures, while also helping professors spend less time answering questions during these lectures. It will be a live question answering service where students can ask a question, and other students can provide an answer, without having to stop the professor. If no students have the answer, then students can raise their hand to ask the professor. This will be especially halpful for large lectures with hundreds of students, where at any given moment many likely have a question without a way to approproately ask all of them.

Key features:
- Live peer-to-peer communication.
- Ability for anyone to submit a question at any time.
- Ability to save and store unanswered questions so the professor can answer them later.
